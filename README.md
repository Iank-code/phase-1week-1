#Description
#Net Salary Calculator
This is a web app that calculates the gross salary. It takes in net salary and deducts nhif and nssf and also gives tax relief. The user can choose either monthly or Annually and the app performs a series of functions and displays the results.

#Speed Detection
This web app takes in the speed of a moving vehicle or motorbike and in turn, it gives out demerit points. The more the demerit points, the increased chance of licencce suspension. For every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points.

#Student Grade Generator
In this app, the user enters a student marks and the input should be between 0 and 100.Then output the correct grade: 

A > 79, B - 60 to 79, C -  59 to 49, D - 40 to 49, E - less 40.
